        <p><b>IDRBind</b> is a protein interface predictor built specifically for binding sites of molecular recognition
            features (MoRFs), which are interaction mediating elements in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).</p>

        <p>Protein-protein interactions have a fundamental role in most biological processes and many computational
            methods have been created for the prediction of these interaction interfaces based on protein structure.
            Most of these methods have been trained and tested on classical globular-globular protein interactions.
            However, a large fraction of interactions is mediated by MoRFs, which play an especially prominent role
            in signaling and regulation. IDRBind is a method built to predict MoRF-binding sites on structures of
            folded proteins. It makes use of information from residue composition, residue evolutionary conservation,
            residue relative accessible surface area (rASA), surface geometry, estimated B-factor and electrostatics.</p>

        <p><b>PDB file</b> - Upload the protein(s) coordinates in standard PDB file format. It is recommended to have properly terminated
            chains. When multiple models of the protein are available, only the first model in the file is used.<p>
        <p><b>PDB Chain ID(s)</b> - You must specify one or more protein chains matching those found in the PDB file (e.g. AB).</p>
        <p><b>FASTA file</b> - We also require a sequence file in the FASTA format labeled with matching chain ID.</p>
